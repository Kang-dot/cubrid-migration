 * A {@link Runnable} task that belongs to one source table, so a per-key executor (see {@code
 * MultiQueueExecutor}) can group all of a table's work onto one shared queue instead of handing out
 * a new one per calling thread.
 *
 * <p>Without this, {@code MultiQueueExecutor} keys its queues by {@code
 * Thread.currentThread().getId()} - fine when one table's export was always exactly one thread, but
 * once {@code TableSplitPlanner} lets a table's export run as N parallel range threads, each range
 * thread is a distinct caller and silently claims its own {@code importThreadCount}-sized queue, so
 * one split table ends up with {@code N * importThreadCount} import threads instead of the
 * configured {@code importThreadCount}.
