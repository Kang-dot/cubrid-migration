/**
 * Regression coverage for {@link SingleQueueExecutor}'s task-count limit.
 *
 * <p>The limit used to be enforced by a loop that slept 200 ms between checks <em>while holding
 * the executor's monitor</em>. Two things followed: every other submitter stood BLOCKED on the
 * monitor behind the one sleeper, and a freed slot was only noticed at the next 200 ms tick - so
 * several parallel export ranges feeding one table's import queue spent most of their time asleep
 * while the importers sat idle, capping throughput at roughly one queue-full per 200 ms.
 *
 * <p>The tests drive that through thread states and latches (a blocked submitter is either
 * TIMED_WAITING on the monitor or BLOCKED behind someone) rather than through elapsed time, except
 * where a generous bound is the point.
